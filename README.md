# Calculator-VanillaJS

For this project I have created a calculator using Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

## UI Design 

The design I have created includes basic operations, the ability to delete the last entered digit and to reset the calculator back to 0 by pressed AC. The previous operation is visible above the current value.
